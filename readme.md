# The perfect start for your new project.
### A simple CSS framework with gulp automation

candor is the simple and tidy css framework. Initially it was used to create Wordpress themes, but now it's a perfect fit for whatever you want to create.

# Acknowledgment
candor uses some 3rd party components. Thank you!   
A lot of code was only possible to write because of wonderful & helpful people in user forums or their blog articles. Whenever some helped me with their answers or articles, I added a link to the code.
